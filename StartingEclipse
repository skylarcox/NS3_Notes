To start eclipse, browse to the folder on the desktop and enter the directory.  Then use the following command to start the application:

sudo ./eclipse

That will start the program and from there you can edit code.  

To run the code that has been edited, browse to the ns-3-allinone/ns-3-dev directory and use command:

./waf --run path/filename, where path and file are the path to the file and filename is the name of the file (without extension).  For example, browse to '/ns-3-allinone/ns-3-dev':

./waf --run scratch/edited_first

'edited_first' is the file 'edited_first.cc' and 'scratch' is the folder where the file is located.

If there is ever a problem with setting the java path, enter the following in the eclipse.ini file:
 
-vm
/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_91/bin/java

This will come just after the launcher entry and just before the -vmargs entry.

Should look similar to:

%%%%%
"...
	openFile
	--launcher.appendVmargs
	-vm
	/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_91/bin/java
	-vmargs
	-Dosgi.re
..."
%%%%%%
